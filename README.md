This Python program models a family tree using object-oriented programming, where each family member is represented by a `Person` class instance stored in a central dictionary. The `Family_Tree` class provides methods to explore relationships such as parents, siblings, grandparents, cousins, and spouses, as well as demographic insights like average number of children, average age at death, and birthday calendars. The program includes an interactive menu for users to query and explore the family tree data.
